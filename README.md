# Java Source Analyzer

## Description
This is a simple project, an exercise in learning Go. It will traverse 
a directory and look for files with the .java extension and count
the number of files, the number of non-comment lines and the
number of comment lines and print the result.

## Build
Assuming go is installed and working, typing the below will
build the executable
```shell
go build
```

## Running


## Feedback
Although unlikely, if anyone would like to submit some PRs with some
improvements, for learning, it would be greatly appreciated.
